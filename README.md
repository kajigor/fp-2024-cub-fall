# Scientific Calculator
A fully functional scientific calculator implemented in Haskell. This project supports a variety of mathematical operations and functions, including:

- Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Advanced Functions: Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), logarithmic functions (log, ln), and exponentiation.
- Constants: Predefined constants such as π (Pi) and e (Euler's number).
- Error Handling: Graceful handling of invalid inputs and operations.
- Memory Management: Store and retrieve values using a memory feature.
- Interactive REPL: A command-line interface for user interaction.
- Extensive Testing: Unit and property-based tests ensure correctness and reliability.

The project is built with a modular architecture using the Text.Parsec library for parsing and supports floating-point computations with error tolerance.
